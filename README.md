# Python commandline-tool for mapping and storing wifi-access-points with geo-location

A CLI-script tool written in python for mapping and storing wifi's in a database. 

Inspired by the practice of war-driving and a curiosity concerning the status-quo of wifi's in the city I live in.

Note: Requieres some gps-module or gps-tool that feeds data in NMEA-format to the script.
