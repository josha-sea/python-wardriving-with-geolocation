# Python Script for mapping wifi to geo-location

A shell script written in python for mapping and storing wifi's in a database with geo-location. 

Inspired by the practice of war-driving and a curiosity concerning the status-quo of wifi's in the city I live in.

Note: Requieres some gps-module or gps-tool that feeds data in NMEA-format to the script. I use the GPS Module G-Mouse VK-162 from aliexpress (no affilliation)
